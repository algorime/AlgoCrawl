Below is a high-level, code-free plan that outlines how to build a crawler using Playwright in TypeScript that explores every page in two layers of depth:

---

## 1. Overall Concept

**Dual-Depth Approach:**

- **Page Depth:**  
  The crawler treats each navigable page (reached via links or form submissions) as a separate unit. For every new page that is loaded, it performs an initial crawl (compiling forms, clickable elements, etc.) similar to a standard crawler.

- **Dynamic Depth:**  
  Within each page, the crawler actively simulates interactions. It clicks every clickable element and submits every form, then observes if the page’s DOM changes dynamically (via AJAX, HTML5 updates, etc.). If a dynamic change is detected, it triggers a secondary crawl on that updated state. This dynamic exploration is recursive in nature: each newly revealed state is re-analyzed for forms and clickable elements.

## 2. The Crawl Process

### A. Initial Page Load

1. **Load the Page:**
   - Start by opening the target URL in a headless browser session.
   - Ensure that all initial resources load and the page reaches a “settled” state (e.g., waiting until network activity subsides).

2. **Compile Interactive Elements:**
   - **Forms:** Identify and list all form elements present on the page.
   - **Clickable Elements:** Identify all clickable elements such as links, buttons, and other elements that trigger events.

3. **Baseline Analysis:**
   - Record the state of the DOM.
   - Log the presence of forms and clickable elements for later comparison.

### B. Processing Forms and Navigational Links (Page Depth)

1. **Submit Forms:**
   - For each form, prepare a submission (possibly using default or test values).
   - Submit the form and monitor for:
     - Full-page navigations.
     - Partial page updates (AJAX responses).
   - If a new page or state is loaded, add it to the crawl queue for a full-page depth analysis.

2. **Follow Navigational Links:**
   - Extract URLs from links that meet the “in scope” criteria.
   - Enqueue these URLs for a fresh crawl process (starting again from initial page load).

### C. Simulated Interactions on the Same Page (Dynamic Depth)

1. **Iterate Through Clickable Elements:**
   - For each clickable element on the original page:
     - Simulate a click.
     - Wait briefly for any DOM changes (using a mechanism such as a MutationObserver conceptually, without getting into code details).
   
2. **Detecting Dynamic Changes:**
   - Compare the post-click DOM with the baseline:
     - If there’s no significant change, mark that element as “inactive” for dynamic exploration.
     - If the DOM changes—whether through partial updates (e.g., AJAX) or new elements appearing—treat the updated state as a new dynamic context.
   
3. **Dynamic Exploration:**
   - In the updated state:
     - Recompile the forms and clickable elements.
     - Submit any new forms or click new elements in the updated view.
     - If these interactions lead to additional in-scope pages or substantial changes, queue those pages/states for further exploration at the page depth level.
   
4. **Recursive Behavior:**
   - Apply the same dynamic depth process to every new state produced by a click. Each new state gets its “dynamic” pass where forms are compiled, elements clicked, and DOM changes re-evaluated.

## 3. Control and Management

### A. Tracking and Limits

- **Visited States:**  
  Maintain a record of visited URLs and dynamic states (possibly via a normalized snapshot of the DOM or unique identifiers) to avoid processing the same state multiple times.

- **Depth Controls:**
  - **Page Depth Limit:**  
    Prevent endless navigation by setting a maximum depth for new pages.
  - **Dynamic Depth Limit:**  
    Prevent infinite recursions on dynamic interactions by setting a threshold on how many sequential dynamic changes will be processed.

### B. Concurrency and Threading

- **Parallel Processing:**  
  To speed up the process, consider handling different elements (or even pages) concurrently.  
  - One approach is to handle clickable element interactions in a separate asynchronous thread or worker.
  
- **Synchronization:**  
  Ensure that multiple dynamic interactions on the same page do not conflict. Carefully log and control the states so that each new state is correctly captured and queued.

### C. Scoping and Filtering

- **In-Scope Verification:**  
  Define criteria for what constitutes an “in scope” page or state. This could be based on domain, URL patterns, or specific page characteristics.
  
- **Element Selection Rules:**  
  Avoid elements that are likely to lead out-of-scope or produce redundant states (such as login buttons, social media widgets, etc.).

## 4. Error Handling and Logging

### A. Error Recovery

- **Timeouts and Retries:**  
  Implement a timeout after each click or form submission. If no response is detected, log the event and move on.
  
- **State Restoration:**  
  If a dynamic interaction leads to an unstable state, provide a way to revert to the last known good state or simply log the failure and continue.

### B. Logging and Auditing

- **Event Logging:**  
  Log every interaction, including form submissions, clickable element activations, and DOM changes.
  
- **Result Tracking:**  
  Record which interactions led to new pages or dynamic content to help with debugging and to fine-tune the crawler’s behavior over time.

## 5. Integration with a Larger Framework

- **Modularity:**  
  Keep the core crawling engine separate from the dynamic interaction logic. This separation ensures you can later integrate additional analysis (like vulnerability scanning) without affecting the base crawling functions.
  
- **Extensibility:**  
  Design the system in modules (initial load, dynamic depth exploration, state management) so that new features (e.g., deeper content analysis, enhanced form submission heuristics) can be added later.

## 6. Final Thoughts

This plan describes a comprehensive approach where every page is not just loaded and scanned for links and forms, but is also actively "played" with: every interactive element is clicked, and any resulting dynamic changes trigger a secondary analysis loop. This dual approach—combining the static page depth and the dynamic depth—ensures that the crawler is thorough, capturing both traditional navigational elements and modern AJAX-driven or HTML5 dynamic content.

The key is in orchestrating a controlled, recursive exploration while tracking visited states, managing concurrency, and setting practical limits to avoid endless loops. This approach is conceptually similar to the dynamic analysis seen in commercial tools like Acunetix DeepScan and the ZAP client spider, but adapted to a Playwright and TypeScript environment.
