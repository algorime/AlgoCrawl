# Project Progress Summary

This document aggregates the work completed so far, detailing improvements across the crawler's core components and optimization efforts.

## Current Project Status

- **Crawler Engine (src/crawlerEngine.ts)**
  - Loads URLs using Playwright.
  - Logs page titles and tracks AJAX requests with retry mechanisms and detailed error/time logging.

- **Page Analyzer (src/pageAnalyzer.ts)**
  - Extracts interactive elements such as links and forms from the page.

- **Entry Point (src/index.ts)**
  - Initiates the crawling process.
  - Accepts a URL as a command-line argument (defaults to "https://example.com").

- **Core Features:**
  - **AJAX Handling:** 
    - Efficient correlation of requests and responses with robust error management.
  - **Element Interaction:** 
    - Implements multiple click strategies: standard click, JavaScript-triggered click, and position-based click.
  - **Configuration Options:**
    - Supports proxy configuration, SSL/HTTPS handling, customizable timeouts, domain control, and detailed logging.

## Crawler Concurrency Optimization Discussion

- Improved logging and debugging for form interactions to handle issues more effectively.
- Introduced a global `InteractionTracker` to prevent duplicate processing of forms and interactive elements.
- Enhanced URL normalization by sorting query parameters and consistent formatting within the `UrlQueue`, thereby reducing redundant URL processing.

## Crawler Concurrency Optimization Issues

- Addressed repeated interactions by refining deduplication logic in the `UrlQueue` class.
- Improved URL tracking with enhanced state checks and normalization to avoid looping over already processed URLs.
- Strengthened error tracking and recovery mechanisms for better reliability during crawling.

## Crawler Element Interaction Optimization

- Optimized detection of interactive elements, especially for JavaScript links and elements with action/onClick handlers.
- Implemented fallback strategies to interact with elements effectively:
  - Standard browser click
  - JavaScript-initiated click
  - Position-based click
- Added post-interaction analysis to rescan pages for any new interactive elements, ensuring thorough processing.

## Next Steps

- Implement deep crawling through enhanced URL queue and state management.
- Further refine dynamic interaction processing and error recovery mechanisms.
- Continue optimizing performance while ensuring robust handling of all interactive elements.

# Current Status

## Core Functionality
- ✅ Basic crawler setup with Playwright
- ✅ Configuration system with customizable options
- ✅ Page analysis and element detection
- ✅ Smart element interaction system
- ✅ AJAX request handling and monitoring
- ✅ Proxy support with HTTPS error handling

## Recent Improvements

### AJAX Handling
- Implemented smart AJAX request tracking
- Dynamic network activity monitoring
- Efficient request/response correlation
- Response content and timing capture
- Automatic retry mechanisms for failed requests

### Interaction System
- Smart click strategies with multiple fallbacks:
  - Standard click
  - JavaScript click
  - Position-based click
- Efficient waiting strategy:
  - Network idle detection (300ms threshold)
  - Response-based progression (500ms after responses)
  - Short polling intervals (50ms)
  - No artificial delays

### Performance Optimizations
- Removed unnecessary fixed delays
- Smart timeout handling based on network activity
- Efficient request queue monitoring
- Early progression when responses are received
- Optimized retry mechanisms

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error capture
- Failed request tracking
- Detailed timing information
- Response status monitoring
- Connection error handling

## Configuration Options
- Proxy support with SSL/HTTPS handling
- Customizable timeouts
- Domain scope control
- Screenshot capabilities
- Logging levels

## Current Limitations
- Single-page crawling (depth management pending)
- Basic form interaction
- Limited JavaScript event handling

## Next Steps
- Implement depth-first crawling
- Enhance form interaction capabilities
- Add JavaScript event simulation
- Improve error recovery mechanisms
- Add concurrent page handling
